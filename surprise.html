    <h1>To My Love ❤️</h1>
    <p>I know you're very busy nowadays, and we don't get to talk as much as we used to. I miss the old us, where we would talk all the time, even on weekends, with all the cuteness and sweetness. 💕</p>
    <p>I just want you to know how much I love you and how much I cherish every moment with you. Here's a little reminder of us:</p>

    <!-- Romantic Message -->
    <div class="romantic-message">
      <p>Every moment with you feels like a dream. 💖</p>
      <p>You are my sunshine on cloudy days, my calm in the chaos, and my everything. 🌟</p>
      <p>I love you more than words can express, and I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with you. ❤️</p>
      <p>Babe, I miss you deeply, more than I can put into words. Every day without you feels incomplete. 💔</p>
      <p>I wish you could see how much I long for your presence, how much I crave to hear your voice and feel your touch. 💞</p>
      <p>Being apart from you has made me realize how truly special you are to me. I miss our moments together, and I dream of the day we'll be reunited. 🌠</p>
      <p>Until then, please know that you are always in my thoughts and heart. I love you endlessly. 💖</p>
